# Are Amazon delivery hubs making neighborhoods less healthy and more dangerous?

The article studied here is from theguardian.com, titled “Are Amazon delivery hubs making neighborhoods less healthy and more dangerous?”, available online via: [Click Here](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/20/amazon-warehouse-new-york-brooklyn-red-hook)

This is a _“print media”_ article. Even though the article is posted online, it is classified as print media as it is produced by a traditional media outlet and published on the media’s official website (theguardian.com, the digital form of The Guardian newspaper). It follows standard journalistic practices and is written by trained journalists.

The article examines how Amazon delivery hubs impact neighbourhoods' health and safety. It highlights concerns that these hubs can lead to increased traffic congestion, pollution, and noise, which may negatively affect residents' well-being and create hazardous conditions.

The initial paragraphs provide context on Amazon delivery hubs, explaining their growing presence and potential impact on communities. They outline why understanding the effects of these hubs is crucial, particularly given their increasing role in urban areas. This background sets the stage for discussing the specific health and safety concerns associated with their proliferation.

The lede of the article is located in the first paragraph, written in **Bold**: “Brooklyn residents are using air quality and traffic sensors to see how new warehouses affect their community”. The lede effectively sets up the central issue of the article by highlighting the residents' efforts to monitor the impact of new Amazon delivery hubs.

The summary of the story is located towards the middle of the article, highlights that:

Opposition from local residents and the lack of community engagement are significant factors in the issues faced by Red Hook. The article explains that the new Amazon facilities have led to increased traffic and declining air quality, which residents and local advocates are actively monitoring and responding to.

This is conveys readers that the specific issue raises concerns among the local neighbourhood where recent Amazon warehouse facility located. It is expected that the reader would understand that the main victims of Amazon's expansion are local people, and thisperspective is clearly depicted from the impacted point of view.

The main results of the story are discussed towards the end of the article:

-	Proposed regulatory changes in response to the issues observed. These include potential new zoning rules and legislation aimed at controlling the expansion of last-mile delivery hubs and mitigating their impact on neighborhoods.

-	The results emphasize the ongoing efforts to address the negative effects of such facilities on local communities and the environment.

The main result are divided into several paragraphs, aiming to address multiple stakeholders’ actions.



## **List B:** Dear Mona, a column in Fivethirtyeight, episode: What’s The Most Common Name In America?


# What’s The Most Common Name In America?


The blog post studied here is from fivethirtyeight.com website, titled “Dear Mona, What’s The Most Common Name In America?”, available online via: [Click Here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-the-most-common-name-in-america/).


The journalistic structure of this article classifies it as a _“digital media”_ piece. This is because fivethirtyeight.com is an online platform that operates exclusively on the web, using digital formats to publish its content. The site follows a more casual approach to journalism, meaning the structure is not as strict as print media (there may be a different level of editorial oversight because the target audience is also differs from article from print or news media, but it can still be part of a broader digital strategy by media organisations or independent publishers). However, this specific article still includes all components of investigative reporting, fact-checking, and data analysis. This website is also part of an established media organization (ABC News).

The blog highlights the complexities of determining the most common names in America, emphasizing that a nuanced approach considering demographic and social factors is essential, supported by graphs as the result of the writers’ data analysis. Adjusting for these factors reveals significant shifts in the rankings of names and underscores the need for more accurate methodologies.

The background section, starting after the lede, details the challenges and methodologies in analysing name frequencies. It explains how initial data on first names and surnames is collected, processed, and adjusted, addressing limitations and factors like immigration and demographic changes. This context is crucial for understanding why certain names may seem more or less common and for interpreting the complexities of name frequency estimates. 

The lede in this article is: "To get you an answer, my colleague Andrew Flowers and I tried a more sophisticated technique that reached a different conclusion: We think the most common name in America might very well be James Smith. Here’s how we got there". This part can be found in the second paragraph, following the opening paragraph (1st paragraph), as the standard format for the _“Dear Mona”_ column of question and answer (QnA) style.



The summary of the story is in the end of the article:


- The analysis of common names in America reveals that "James Smith" ranks higher than "Michael Smith" when adjusting for demographic and name correlation factors. 

- The study also shows that "Maria Garcia" is significantly more common—700 percent more than initially estimated—due to these adjustments. The article underscores the challenges in accurately determining name frequencies and the necessity for refined methodologies to capture true name distributions.

This tells the reader that by adding more adjustments and variables in the methods of processing data, the results will drastically change. That’s why the writer emphasizes the importance of improving the formula or method to get the most accurate and representative results.

The main result of the story is in the third-to-last paragraph of the article:

- Name Rankings: "Michael Smith" that was previously considered the most common name in America, is surpassed by "James Smith" when accounting for various demographic adjustments.

- Significant Shifts: Adjustments for factors like ethnicity and name correlations reveal that "Maria Garcia" is much more common than previously estimated, climbing to the 15th most common name combination.

- Methodological Challenges: The article highlights the complexity of determining name frequencies and the limitations of basic probability models, emphasizing the need for more nuanced statistical adjustments to better reflect actual name distributions.



## **List C:** How did Australia’s housing market get so bad, and is it all negative gearing’s fault?


# How did Australia’s housing market get so bad, and is it all negative gearing’s fault?

The presentation studied here is from a Youtube channel: **Guardian Australia**, titled “How did Australia’s housing market get so bad, and is it all negative gearing’s fault?”, available online via: [Click Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqUFERBJwoY)


This form of communication is a _“presentation”_, more specifically a _"visual and auditory data communication"_. It can effectively conveys data and information through various means, such as: 

- Visuals: Charts, graphs, animations, and other visual aids help illustrate complex data. 

- Narration: Spoken explanations can provide context and insights.

- Text: On-screen text highlight key points or data.

- Music and Sound Effects: These enhance engagement and retention of information.

YouTube videos, in general, are useful for making data more engaging and can reach a broader audience.


The video begins in an unconventional way by showing a graph that illustrates the gap between the rising house prices and the disposable income (using GDP per Capita as a metric) of Australians (00:02–00:26). 

The lede then mentiones that _"negative gearing"_ is often blamed for the crisis. (00.40 - 00.50)


The summary of the story is provided at the end of the video:


- The combination of policies mixing income with investment income before calculating tax, capital gains tax, and negative gearing has created a loophole. This loophole has been exploited by some to reduce their taxes, but it has also indirectly caused house prices to rise uncontrollably (throughout the video, scattered from minute 01:00 to 04:00).

- The narrator uses “satire” to highlight the affected parties, including average Australians wanting to buy a new home, renters, constituents, the Australian government (which earns less tax revenue), and the Australian economy in general (04:36–04:50).

This tells the viewer about the two sides of the policy: while it can benefit some, it can also cause catastrophic problems on the other end.

Main results:

- he exploitation of policy loopholes in Australia’s property industry is clearly explained. If someone wants to reduce their annual tax income, they can invest in property (real estate), especially in property that results in a loss (in the example, the loss reaches $20,000), so that this loss can deduct the tax that needs to be paid from income tax (01:30–02:50).

- The result of this exploitation practice, combined with tax breaks for selling property, has created a housing price bubble since the 1990s because both sellers and buyers benefit from the practice (03:00–03:30).
